# TriNovDoc

Hi everyone,

This is a silly document for some tips in triathlon - based on my experiences as the Men's captain in OUTriC over the past year. This is purely for personal use and it does not reflect any policies of OUTriC! Feel free to have a look, and drop me a message at lucas.leung@physics.ox.ac.uk if you have any comments!

Trilove,
Lucas
